# LING 490 Capstone: CT Realizations in Attention Patterns for Chinese Zero Anaphora Resolution

This project aims to investigate 
1) whether Chinese zero anaphora resolution according to several proposed instantiations of Centering Theory (Grosz et al.) is realized in multi-head attention networks
2) where this realization occurs in the network

transitions.ipynb: 
* converts OntoNotes documents into usable components for retrieving indices of relevant tokens
* compares attention patterns in selected heads/layers of given model to Cf rankings
Implementation details can be found within the file.

sentence_piece.ipynb:
* trains a sentence piece tokenizer for whole-word segmentation of Chinese text on held-out portions of the OntoNotes datasets.

visual_analysis.ipynb (TBD):
* compares the alignment of CT instantiations to attention patterns. 
* compares the performance of CT instantiations in resolving zero-anaphora
* generates visualizations of comparisons

Data:
This project utilizes version 5.0 of the [OntoNotes dataset](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) released by the Linguistic Data Consortium
